osmdroid is a library to interact with OpenStreetMap data inside an Android application. It offers an almost full/free replacement to Android map objects: MapView, MapController, Overlays, etc.

This "OSMBonusPack" library complements osmdroid with (very) useful classes:
  * [Markers](Tutorial_0.md) with nice and flexible "cartoon-bubbles",
  * [Routes and Directions](Tutorial_1.md),
  * [Points of Interests](Tutorial_2.md) (directory services),
  * [Marker Clustering](Tutorial_3.md),
  * Polyline, [Polygon](Tutorial_5.md) and [GroundOverlay](Tutorial_5.md), similar to their Google Maps equivalents,
  * Support for [KML and GeoJSON](Tutorial_4.md) content,
  * Geocoding and Reverse Geocoding,
  * Integrated Cache Management tools for off-line maps
  * and more...

Have a look to the [Features](Features.md).

The [OSMNavigator](OSMNavigator.md) application demonstrates the use of these classes. This is a generic-purpose Map/Navigation tool, including a KML viewer and editor.
